# What is Neovimacs?
Neovimacs is actually a configuration tool that sets up an Alpine Linux environment
for development with neovim. It can correctly configure the system and packages

The configuration of the system is done using Lua, and works similarly to Wezterm.
You create a lua module which returns a configuration of the system, and Neovimacs
sets up the Alpine system accordingly. Neovimacs is designed to work in virtualized 
environments and containers
